        <p>I am currently studying to become a UX-designer at EC-education in 
            Malm√∂ and will take my degree in the spring of 2023. 
            I have my work background in the Swedish legal system, but my 
            thoughts wandered every day to a job where I could be creative and innovative. 
            So one day I came across the concept of UX design and from there it all started. 
            My goals when it comes to my career within UX is to design meaningfully and help 
            make the digital sphere useful and simple for everyone.
            
            In addition to having found a love for UX, my heart beats a little 
            extra for travel, chocolate and to enjoy the sun and sea on a sandy beach. In fact, 
            it would be a dream to someday in the future live in warmer latitudes. </p>

    <div class="om_mig">
        <p>It's important to enjoy what you do everyday, as simple as that. 
        If you are not happy with where you are in life, career or private, have the courage to change it.

        <h2>Be curious about the outside world</h2>

    <div class="om_mig">
        <p>Being attentive to one's surroundings often leads to new knowledge, experiences and encounters. My ambition is always to be as good as possible at what I do and never consider myself fully trained.
